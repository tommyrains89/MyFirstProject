# My First Project

Hi everyone! 👋  
This is my very first GitHub project.  
I'm still learning how Git, GitHub, and coding in general all work together,  
so this repo is mostly me experimenting with things and getting used to the workflow.

## What’s this project?

Honestly… nothing serious 😅  
I just wanted to create a repo so I can practice:

- committing files
- pushing to GitHub
- organizing folders
- writing basic scripts
- learning Markdown

Eventually I might turn this into something real (maybe a small automation tool),  
but for now it’s just a sandbox for me to mess around.

## My dog 🐶

I also wanted to try uploading images,  
so here is a picture of my dog **Scout** during a walk in the park yesterday:

He likes running around while I sit on a bench with my laptop pretending to “work” 😂

## Current files

- `test.py` – me experimenting with Python loops  
- `notes.txt` – random coding notes  
- `scout.jpg` – testing image upload  
- more stuff coming soon!

If you see this repo by accident: hi!  
I'm still new to all this, so don't judge the messy structure too hard 😅
